# Spotify-Machine-Learning
Using Spotify's REST API to gather data, and analyze and predict with the gathered data.
# <b>Spotify Billboard Music Analysis</b>

The overall goal of the project:

 - Gather data on every single track in Spotify's Top 100 Billboard playlist <i>(as of November 23, 2022)</i> using Spotify's REST API and the requests module in Python.

 - Create visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly and perform analysis with the data that I find. 
 
 - Make educated predictions through the use of Scikit to answer the question: "What makes a hit song?"
